        answer:
          "Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data where the desired output is known, while unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in unlabeled data without predefined outputs. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs, while in unsupervised learning, the algorithm identifies inherent structures in the data.",
        feedback:
          "Good explanation of the core differences. You correctly identified that supervised learning uses labeled data while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. Your answer could be improved by providing specific examples of algorithms for each type.",

        text: "Describe how neural networks mimic the human brain and provide an example of their application.",
        answer:
          "Neural networks mimic the human brain through interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information. They use weighted connections that adjust during training, similar to how synapses in the brain strengthen with learning. An example application is image recognition, where convolutional neural networks can identify objects in images by detecting patterns and features at different levels of abstraction.",
        feedback:
          "Excellent explanation of the parallel between neural networks and the human brain. Your example of image recognition using CNNs is appropriate and well-explained. To improve, you could mention the concept of activation functions and how they relate to the firing of neurons in the brain.",

        text: "Discuss the ethical implications of using AI in automated decision-making systems.",
        answer:
          "The use of AI in automated decision-making raises several ethical concerns. First, there's the issue of bias and fairness, as AI systems can perpetuate or amplify existing biases in training data. Second, there's a lack of transparency in how AI makes decisions, often functioning as a 'black box.' Third, questions of accountability arise when determining who is responsible for AI-made decisions. Finally, there are concerns about privacy and consent regarding the data used to train these systems.",
        feedback:
          "Very comprehensive discussion of the ethical implications. You've covered the major concerns including bias, transparency, accountability, and privacy. Your answer demonstrates a good understanding of the complex ethical landscape surrounding AI decision-making. To enhance your answer, you could have included specific examples of controversial AI decision-making systems.",
