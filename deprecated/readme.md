# Deprecated Archive

This folder contains legacy code that was once part of the active codebase but has since been replaced by newer tools, architectures, or implementations.

## Purpose

The sole purpose of this folder is **reference**.
As the codebase evolves, older methods may be superseded by more efficient or maintainable solutions. However, in large or legacy-integrated systems, referencing deprecated logic can be valuable â€” especially for debugging regressions, understanding historical decisions, or maintaining compatibility.

> Do not reuse code from this folder in production without review.
